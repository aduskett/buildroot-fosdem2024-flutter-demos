# By default, bcm2712_defconfig selects 16K page sizes to allow running ARM32
# binaries. However, there are two issues with this:
#   1) Buildroot has no need to run ARM32 binaries, as everything is compiled for AARCH64.
#   2) All of the pre-compiled toolchains are built using 4K page sizes.
# As such, revert back to 4K page sizes.
